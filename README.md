# UriBuilderExtended
Extensions to .NET's `System.UriBuilder`.

## Introduction
A thing that is missing from .NET's `System.UriBuilder` is a good way to edit the query string. That is what made me look for others solution to this problem, and ultimately made me start this project.

Other good solutions exist that may cover your needs, but I was unable to find one that that covered my requirements:

1. Do anything `UriBuilder` does
2. Set the query string with support for multiple values
3. Be as simple as possible

I have built this with great inspiration from [URI.js](https://medialize.github.io/URI.js/), which is a very good library for modifying URIs in JavaScript.
